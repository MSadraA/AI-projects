    "### Task: Implement the `dissimilarity_measure` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dissimilarity_measure` method calculates how different two puzzle pieces are when placed next to each other. This is a key part of the fitness function, as it determines how well pieces fit together.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You Need to Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Implement the `_dissimilarity_measure` method** in the `ImageAnalysis` class.\n",
    "-   The method should take two `PIL.Image` objects (`piece1`, `piece2`) and an `orientation` string (`\"L-R\"` for left-right or `\"T-D\"` for top-down).\n",
    "-   It should return a single `float` value representing the dissimilarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Convert Images to NumPy Arrays**: Use `np.asarray(piece)` to convert the `PIL.Image` objects into NumPy arrays. This makes it easier to perform mathematical operations on the pixel data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Extract Edges**: Depending on the `orientation`, you need to extract the pixels from the touching edges of the two pieces.\n",
    "    -   For `\"L-R\"` (Left-Right), you need the **right edge of `piece1`** and the **left edge of `piece2`**.\n",
    "    -   For `\"T-D\"` (Top-Down), you need the **bottom edge of `piece1`** and the **top edge of `piece2`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Calculate Dissimilarity**: The dissimilarity can be calculated as the **sum of squared differences** between the pixel values of the two edges. The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    dissimilarity = sum((edge1 - edge2)^2)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can use `np.sum()` and basic arithmetic operations on the NumPy arrays to compute this value."
